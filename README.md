# About Project 
this project is an api in nodejs, using express, which receives calls to post cities/users and pick up cities/users.
It's a project of a youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVepTuBK4V0&list=PL29TaWXah3iaaXDFPgTHiFMBF6wQahurP

What I added in this project was the database in a docker and not in the cloud.
